# Docker

All notes on Docker divided into 2 files.

- [Part 1](https://github.com/SSaquif/docker-notes/blob/master/part-1.md): Docker Fundamentals using a single react app as example
- [Part 2](https://github.com/SSaquif/docker-notes/blob/master/part-2.md): Running Multi Container Apps. Uses a full stack Mern App as example. Also covers Deployment (Perhaps Part 3)
